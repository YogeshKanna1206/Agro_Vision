🌱 AgroVision – AI-Powered Smart Agriculture Platform

AgroVision is an AI-driven web application designed to help farmers and agricultural stakeholders make early, data-driven decisions by combining crop disease detection, crop lifecycle simulation, and financial risk analysis into a single intelligent system.

Instead of reacting after crop damage occurs, AgroVision focuses on predicting risks early and supporting better planning.
